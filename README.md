# weather-dashboard

## Description
The weather dashboard dynamically displays the current weather and the 5 day forecast for the city searched by the user. My motivation for creating this project was so that anboyd who uses my app can easily access the weather data of their city. During the development of this application I learned how tot call an API using the fetch method. I also learned how to utilize this data to be able todynaicamlly display the information on the webpage.

## Future Development
In future development I plan on fixing the "button bug" where when a user inputs a input that is not valid, it is added to the hisotry and a button is created even though it is not functional. I also intend on imporving the style and layout of the application.
